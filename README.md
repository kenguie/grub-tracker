# Grub-tracker

### Description
Grub-tracker is used basically to alert groups that there is food ordered and coming.
Many people don't know when someone in their organization has ordered food.
They end up wasting food and money though when someone does order food and they end up getting something for themselves.
This alert system's goal is to alert friends and co-workers as soon as someone knows food is coming.
